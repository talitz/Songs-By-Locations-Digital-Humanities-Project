Covered up with grime you started up to climb.
When you fall you know you fucked it up this time.

Think you got it right?
Well try to be polite or you'll end up all alone at night

I've known you for so long and still I do it all so wrong.
Baby put the gun down.

Drink until you cry and ask yourself
Why can't you just let it go by?

Think you're in control?
Well look deep down your soul
