I never met a girl like you before
You always wait for me behind the door
And I am sure that you will kill my pain
Cause in your arms its warm and never rains
I never dreamt to let you slip away
Cause without you there is no night or day
And in your endless fields there are no walls
To stop me or to tell me that Im wrong
So come to me with tunes and melodies
And Blur that day-to-day reality
The time never ends when I ride your wings
Somehow...
I never met a girl like you before
We climb all hills as if they werent at all
For us its just a glide from song to song
Believing in your love Im getting strong
