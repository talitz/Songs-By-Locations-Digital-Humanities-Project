Wish I’d find a way to tell her
How she’s everything I know
She’s the river to my flow
And the sea when I get home
And the bravery in my battles
But she never mentions her own
If I could find a righteous way
I would surely let her know

That I can see the stars arising in her eyes
Shine forevermore
And then I see a young girl running
She calls me to remind me where I’m from

I am drowning in her waters
That are full of desperate hope
But she’s a river that I know
I’ll always lay upon her shores
And I can see the stars arising in her eyes
Shine forevermore
And then I see a young girl running
She calls me to remind me where I’m from
