Oh lord I see what brings me here
It’s a mother to all my wanderings
The valley’s green will age with me
It’s dirt will shine and linger

And girls will come in festive clothes
And the boys will wait gazing
And birds will sing from tops of trees
And sound like falling angels

Oh mothers I see you hold
All the fruits of our love
And we’ll raise them high
They’ll touch the sky
We’ll walk and work this earth
As the night falls i'll see you home
As the night falls i'll see you home
