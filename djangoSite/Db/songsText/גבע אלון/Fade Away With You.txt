Through endless windows
See but don’t touch
I’m chased away towards
Your open arms
Between walls of dreamland
We sit and stare
And life sings to us
We clap our hands

I see my troubles
Blowing in the void
As war is upon us
And our lives go on
We live in the country
But can’t avoid
The sound of bombers
Above our home

I can see a figure of the son I’ll know
And he’ll be strong and colorful
His eyes will shelter love
And see through the fog
You know that he’ll find a righteous path to all
And end the war
And I want to fade away with you
Oh I want to fade away with you
