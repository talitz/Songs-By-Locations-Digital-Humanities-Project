Well here comes the tune in this curing full moon
Drawing fields of pasture before our eyes
And as the empty night comes
You can lean on me love ’til the dawn
For here comes the tune
Looking back I can see how the light is guiding me
Now that I have you here by my side
And as the empty night comes
We’ll be carried away to the sound
Of a beautiful tune
That’s rocking our minds

And I’m wishing to God you will see
All the innocence that once lived in me
But it was lost and forgotten my name
