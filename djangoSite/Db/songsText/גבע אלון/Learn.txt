If Id ever learn to love you
Like I pass you by
Would you be around and want me
Or will you step aside
Hopes and intentions
They fill my mind
But an act of deliverance
Is riding by
If Id ever learn to love you
When youre not even near by
Would you be around and feel it
Cause now you are but why
As far as my ego will let me slide
I will go with a meaning
Is that enough
Hopes and intentions
They fill my mind
But an act of deliverance
Is riding by
If Id ever learn to love you
Would you love me back
