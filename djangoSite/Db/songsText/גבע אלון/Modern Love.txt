Two, Three, Four...

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try...

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
Still lying in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

I'm never gonna fall for
It walks beside me
Walks on by
Gets me to the church on time
Terrifies me
Makes me party
Puts my trust in god and man
No confessions
No religion
I don't believe in modern love

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
still standing in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

I'm never gonna fall for
it walks beside me
walks on by
gets me to the church on time
terrifies me
makes me party
puts my trust in god and man
no confessions
no religion
i don't believe in modern love

Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love

I don't believe in modern love...
