After all the love is gone,
Rising hands around me.
Shirtless men and painted boys,
Side by side, all alone,
Red light.

Walking through a city i don't know,
Dancing on a stage of endless shows,
Smoke machines in my eyes,
No one hears when you cry.

After all the love is gone,
Diving into music.
Taxi runs through city streets,
Through the night,
Through my heart,
Red light.
