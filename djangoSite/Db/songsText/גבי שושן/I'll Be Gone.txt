You're so young now you're just a baby
Hoping sometimes and your whishing maybe
I might stay here kiss you gently
Look in your eyes oh so intently
But I, I have to go
Don't you cry now cause I’m leaving
There’s no time now for pain and grieving

You better get it straight believe me girl
That from now on I’ll be gone

We had good times I won't forget it
All that happen no I don’t regret it
How I met you your love taught me
Your sweet laughter and how it caught me
But still I have to go
Won't  you listen to what  I’m saying
It’s a high price that we are paying

You better get it straight believe me girl
That from now on I’ll be gone

You can want me you can love me
But you can’t have me no not completely
You can love me like you thought me
But I’m a mover and you can’t hold me
Cause I, I have to go
