so, you said "don't be decieved"
when summer comes you leave
shine your holy light on me.

get undressed is it me?
or is awfully hot in here?
can feel my heart a-beatin'?
knees are shakin' my my

and you you are all i need
and i'm a little kid
and i don't know what you mean
love well it's a tricky thing
it's never what it seems
and i don't know what you mean.

close your weary eyes to sleep
come morning i'll translate your dreams
you tell me if you believe, do you?
well some things I'll never see
you tell me what i'm missing.
can you feel my heart a-beatin'?
knees are shakin' my my...

and you you are all i need...

well i'm sorry if sometimes still
i act a little weird
i don't know how i feel
take now anything from me
i'll give you whatever's missing
can you feel my heart a-beatin'?
knees are shakin' my my.....
