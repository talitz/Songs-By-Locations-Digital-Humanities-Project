There are days I feel insecure
With my body
And with my soul
God help me
Or alcohol

I’m dancing
I’m dancing
Look at me I’m dancing
I’m dancing
I’m dancing
Look at me I’m dancing
And I ain’t embarrassed
Not at all
I mean
look at me!

My friends say I’m an animal
When I’m drunk
They say I’m a
wonderful person when I’m not
They say I’m not myself when I drink
But the truth is
I’m not myself when I’m sober
I think
Therefore I
drink!
Salud!
Lechaim!

I’m dancing
I’m dancing
Look at me I’m dancing
I’m dancing
I’m dancing
Look at me I’m dancing
And I ain’t embarrassed
Not at all
I mean’ look at me!
I said look at me
C’mon baby
Look at me

I don’t feel so good
My head is aching
What did I do last night?
Oh my god…

do I know you

I’m dancing
