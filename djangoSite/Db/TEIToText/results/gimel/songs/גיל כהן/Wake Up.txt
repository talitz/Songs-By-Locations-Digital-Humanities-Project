can i talk to you for a while?
or am i just wasting your time?
we've worked too long at this part time job
of picking up the pieces of what others left behind

but my heart goes to you
may your dreams come true
and i must confess
i'm lost myself
and i'm wlking with you but i'm drifting thru space
and you know i can't wait to get out of this place
and wake up..

hold on to what you got
letting go at this point takes alot
remember when i saw you all dressed in black
you thought i'd be fooled to think act

but my heart goes to you...

it's wrong to feel so alone
before you walk out the door you oughtta know

but my heart goes to you...
