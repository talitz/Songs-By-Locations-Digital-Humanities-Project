she's walking the streets of downtown L.A
sleeps in a different place everyday

she could be anything she wants
a little girl lost in the world
maybe she'll wait for something good
believe in herself if she could
an angel without wings, a bird that can't sing

often she dreams seldom she wakes
reality's been too sour to taste

she could be anything she wants...

may your ways drown your worries
