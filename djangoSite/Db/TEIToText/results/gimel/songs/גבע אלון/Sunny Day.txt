Broken hearts seem not far away
Wont you meet me there
Cause I passed by you this morning
But I cant pass you by
Thinking of you in my mind
Sunny day sunny day
On a lonely aging way
Broken hearts is a place where I
Meet my sanity
With a taste of a new beginning
And leaving worlds behind
Still youre always on my mind
Sunny day sunny day
On a lonely aging way
Sunny day sunny day
But my love is far away
