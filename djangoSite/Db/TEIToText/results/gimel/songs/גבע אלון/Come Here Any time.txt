You can come here any time
The garden is neglected
But the door is open
You can come

Turn the light on and sit with me
We'll no longer live in misery
There's room to hold your burden
My loving is for free

You can call me anytime
Or surprise me at the door
'Cause i don't mind
You can come

Leave your troubled mind behind
And forget about the time
The world is at our fingertips
So why go outside

Shifting sands have drowned me
Blizzards often dusted my soul
Ocean waves have pounded me
Until i found my home

You can come here anytime
The garden is neglected
But the door is open
You can come
Leave your troubled mind behind
And forget about the time
There's room to hold your burden
My love don't cost a dime
