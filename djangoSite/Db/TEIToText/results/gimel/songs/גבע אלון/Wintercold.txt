Yes I know the chill youre spreading
And I know your eyes that burn
And I recognize your lonesome coat
You are to me just like a fairy tale
That I stoll through so all alone
And I know your name
Its Wintercold
Your gown is gray and blue
That are so deep I feel them good
Your wind still blows a word
Through trees that break my heart in two
To meet you here is truly a getaway
And I love you the way you are
You dig in lost despair until its gone
I come to you from great confusion
To find relief in your old ways
Ill try to win your heart
Thats who I am
Your gown is gray and blue
That are so deep I feel them good
Your wind still blows a word
Through trees that break my heart in two
Yes I know the chill youre spreading
And I know your eyes that burn
And I know your name
Its Wintercold
