Near the dam there's an oak tree
Not to far from our land
There I saw my love
Her naked skin shone forever
Her voice it whispered His name
In his arms she fell
I hid myself in the distance
And took some comfort in them
And in my staring I wondered if
To reach her love I still can

For a while I sat and watched them
'Till boredom conquered my mind
In the setting sun
I grabbed a rock hard and solid
Thought of giving some hell
As the evening dwelled
Made my way toward the oak tree
Ant hit the man till he was dead
And to the girl that cried I said
To reach your love I still can

Beyond the field there's a river
And cool wind chimes through The trees
There I Saw My Love
