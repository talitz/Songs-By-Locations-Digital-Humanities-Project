Turning turning around myself
Forget the learning it’s oh so late
She asked me moaning if I would stay
But I just had to run away

I should have been the one
I should have been the one

Today I’m burning but that’s all fine
I chase the foreign and search decline
Been waiting for years to know someone
But when she came I told her none

I should have been the one
I should have been the one

Sometimes I do things all alone
Turning, turning to the thoughts that I’ve killed
The fence is tall but beyond is the real
I should have been someone like all others
I should have loved you when I could
When I could

I should have been the one
I should have been the one

Sometimes I do things all alone
