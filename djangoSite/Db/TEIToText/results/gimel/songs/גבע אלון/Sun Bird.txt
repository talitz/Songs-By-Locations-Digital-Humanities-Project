Come down Sun Bird don't hide
Behind dark feathers lay Your crystal eyes
And I want to see you smile

Come down Sun Bird don't fly
Yes I'm as scared as you are But I can't lie
I want you to say your mine

I know a girl Her name is Bird
And I am hers It's been so long
But still I can't show her love

Won't you come stay with me
'Cause I need someone in My memories
'Cause mine are all just of me

I know a girl Her name is Bird
And I am hers It's been so long
But still I can't show her love
