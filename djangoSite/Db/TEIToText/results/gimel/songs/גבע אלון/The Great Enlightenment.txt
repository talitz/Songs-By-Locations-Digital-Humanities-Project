The seasons in this town all look the same
and I've lost all track of where I am
i hear a song when I call your name
and miss the scents of the ground after the rains

We are aching for the walls to fall
Into the great enlightenment
Let’s not wait until its dawn my love
Before we hit the highway

Dangerous times
To live on the outskirts of town
with open fields all around
keeping you from going downtown
to smile to camera on time
On Friday in the boulevard
Where everything’s going down
When everything's going down

We are aching for the walls to fall
Into the great enlightenment
Let’s not wait until its dawn my love
Before we hit the highway
