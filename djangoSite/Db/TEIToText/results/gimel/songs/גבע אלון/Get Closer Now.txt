I always wished to be around
My brother’s kids as they become
Young folks to gaze at
And to be proud
To know that life will stick around
Through all the rights and wrongs that we’ve sustained forever
But here we are so far from that

Lately I began to wonder
What’s there for me around this town?
Whose skyline shape seem like forever growing monsters
It gets me down, so down

And for the first time
Thoughts grow and roam
And get closer now to where I’m from
I look at the faces that I’ve known since
My younger days and let them see
That I now understand the meaning of relations
And get closer then to who I am

Lately I began to wonder
What’s there for me around this town?
Whose skyline shape seem like forever growing monsters
It gets me down, so down
And weirder scenes appear in my dreams
And when I wake up they never stop
The million people I pass by have blinded faces
It gets me down, So down

Wish I was closer
To life
