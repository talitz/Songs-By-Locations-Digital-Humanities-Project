I think I’m dying here
Will somebody please come and help me
This cant be healthy

I’m standing on the bridge
Looking down
Waiting for an accident
When a car arrives
I comb my hair
Glancing at his window
Fighting off my stare

I think I’m dying here
Will somebody please come and help me
This cant be healthy

At the basketball court
The children are discussing
If I’m alive or not
Lying on the floor
Slumber on a map
My head is in the Golan heights
My feet are in the desert
Sinai

I think I’m dying here
Will somebody please come and help me
This cant be healthy

I can’t move my hands
I can’t feel my legs
It’s just too cold to be outside
