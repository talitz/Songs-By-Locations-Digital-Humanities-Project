what do i need to do
sit around and wait for you
your playing so hard to get
but you might be another bet

you sweet and sour like a lime
and i don't think you need more time
but when i look into your eyes
i want you not other guys

no no no i won't let you go
feel my heart baby see my glow
no no no i won't let you go
feel the beat and then you'll know

now you want to sit and talk
and tell me how its gonna work
you give me your command
i think its gonna end

but when i'm standing next to you
i fly by everything you do
my love to you will never fade
and just for you this song is made

no no no i won't let you go
feel my heart baby see my glow
no no no i won't let you go
feel the beat and then you'll know
