        <head>The Folks Back Home</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>The people back home know everything there is to know about me </l>
          <l>I can be gone for years and still they’ll know where I’ve been </l>
          <l>I read an article in the paper about people like me </l>
          <l>Thought I’d outrun them by now but then back home </l>
          <l>They always see everything that I see before me </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>The people back home tell every story there is to tell about me </l>
          <l>And the stories they come up with are most of the time true </l>
          <l>But me, I get confused by looking in the mirror </l>
          <l>The only time I recognize myself is when I look at my dad </l>
          <l>And get nervous from having to grow old without him</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>There’s a corner in my heart for the folks back home </l>
          <l>There’s a corner in my heart for the folks back home </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>And my daddy says I should always remember my story </l>
          <l>’cause there will come a time when all the folks back home will die </l>
          <l>And that one day I will sit my children down </l>
          <l>And tell them every story there is to tell about the folks back home</l>
          <l>How they knew everything there was to know about me </l>
          <l>And I’ll look at them and hope that one day I could say the same </l>
          <l>There’s a corner in my heart for the folks back home</l>
