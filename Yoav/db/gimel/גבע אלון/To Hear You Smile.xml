        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>He never took a paper</l>
          <l>Never took his pen</l>
          <l>Because he knew</l>
          <l>He could never </l>
          <l>Put into words a thing</l>
          <l>Of the beauty of her face</l>
          <l>Or her white skin or her grace</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>It would all be a lousy second best</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>He never read the papers</l>
          <l>Never watched the news </l>
          <l>Because no breaking reports</l>
          <l>Would ever match his solitude</l>
          <l>And no terror is strong enough</l>
          <l>To blow her from his heart</l>
          <l>She'll always be there</l>
          <l>No matter how bad things are</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>So sad </l>
          <l>I heard him singing</l>
          <l>So deep</l>
          <l>Down from his heart</l>
          <l>So loud</l>
          <l>I just kept swinging</l>
          <l>And loud just ain't loud enough</l>
          <l>Tonight I call you baby</l>
          <l>To hear you smile</l>
          <l>To hear you smile</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>He never wears his coat now</l>
          <l>No umbrella or strong shoes</l>
          <l>Because no winter</l>
          <l>Was ever colder than his blues</l>
          <l>But she will always guide him home</l>
          <l>Though there's still along time to come</l>
          <l>Before that desirable break of dawn</l>
