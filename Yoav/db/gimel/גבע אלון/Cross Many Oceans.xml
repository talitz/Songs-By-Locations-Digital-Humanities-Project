        <head>Cross Many Oceans</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Well I've seen you as you wonder</l>
          <l>I surely know you by now</l>
          <l>And as the time marks our faces</l>
          <l>I see that yours looks a lot like mine</l>
          <l>But I have to cross many oceans</l>
          <l>And walk the streets of many cities and towns </l>
          <l>And then I'll wonder why</l>
          <l>You're not there by my side</l>
          <l>As the morning has shown its diamond</l>
          <l>I have walked away</l>
          <l>Yes the morning has shown its diamond </l>
          <l>And a sparkling rain</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Are you sitting in comfort?</l>
          <l>'Cause I'm restless here</l>
          <l>Many people talk to me</l>
          <l>Most times I don't hear a thing</l>
          <l>But I have to go on the road now</l>
          <l>And make a difference in some far away place</l>
          <l>As long as there's the blues</l>
          <l>I'll have nothing to lose </l>
          <l>And the morning has shown a diamond </l>
          <l>As I walked away</l>
          <l>Thought of asking you to come with me</l>
          <l>Yet I left you there</l>
