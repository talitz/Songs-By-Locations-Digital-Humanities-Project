          <l>I am done, smoking gun </l>
          <l>We've lost it all, the love is gone </l>
          <l>She has won, now it's no fun </l>
          <l>We've lost it all the love is gone </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>And we had magic </l>
          <l>And this is tragic </l>
          <l>You couldn't keep your hands to yourself </l>
        </lg>

          <l>I feel like our world's been infected </l>
          <l>And somehow you left me neglected </l>
          <l>We've found our lives been changed </l>
          <l>Babe you lost me </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>And we tried, oh how we cried </l>
          <l>We lost ourselves, the love has died </l>
          <l>And though we tried you can't deny </l>
          <l>We're left as shells we lost the fight </l>
        </lg>

          <l>And we had magic </l>

          <l>Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet </l>
          <l>But you chose lust when you deceived me </l>
          <l>And you'll be sorry, but it's too late </l>
          <l>How can I ever trust you again? </l>
