After all these years we wanted to believe
that things were gonna change before we wanna leave.
But as the days go by I tell you I'm running all the tricks under my sleeve.
That ain't the way I tell you... ain't the way to live.
Time for them to do it.
Time for them to prove.
Time for us to us stand up.
Time for us to move.
So come on.
