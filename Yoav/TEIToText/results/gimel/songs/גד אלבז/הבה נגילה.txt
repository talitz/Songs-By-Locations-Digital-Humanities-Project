When you feelin low
There’s a place to go
Come and dance with me

When you feel the beat
Stampin in your feet
Dance away, break free

Take two steps to the left
Two steps to the right
And turn around in circles, in circles tonite
Take two steps to the left
Two steps to the right
And turn around in circles, in circles tonite

The beat’s groovin
The circles movin
I’m feelin young and free
The floor’s burning
The circles turning
That’s where I wanna be

Hava Nagila Hava Nagila Hava Nagila La La La
When you feel alone
Lookin for the zone
There’s a place to be

We unite as one
Come and join the fun
Take my hand, and see

Take two steps to the left
Two steps to the right
And turn around in circles, in circles tonite
Take two steps to the left
Two steps to the right
And turn around in circles, in circles tonite

The beat groovin
The circles movin
I feelin young and free
The floor’s burning
