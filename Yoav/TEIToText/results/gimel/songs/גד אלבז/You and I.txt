Keep the faith, take a breath
Before reaching the depths
We must unite
We'll never divide

Close your eyes
Feel the signs
As we follow time
The truth will be found
Deep between the lines

Keep your faith, ignite your soul
Start climbing up from the fall
Now we begin
And fix all our flaws

Rush up your pulse
Because in this universe
We're invincible
Invincible

When the sun will rise
Above in the sky
Spread your wings and fly
Let your bright light shine inside
Flow through your veins
Together we won't hide
You and I
