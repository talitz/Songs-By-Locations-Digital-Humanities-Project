tonight we passed mississippi river
other than that nothing new
came across a place not fit to live in
and a dog howling at the moon
no...no...no...

finally got to NYC
where dreams are cheap and there's nothing to do
met a man there selling time for money
but we couldn't afford his dues
no...no...no...

you say get back get back
you say stay back stay back
you say it's all for you.....

we got lost north south east and west
parked the car on the Brooklyn bridge
we walked on like god sent prophets do
but we sin too much to fool...
god...god...god...

you say get back get back...
