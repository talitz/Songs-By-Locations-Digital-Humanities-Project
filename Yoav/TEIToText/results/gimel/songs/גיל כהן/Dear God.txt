grey clouds
filling up my mind
i've wasted all this time just thinking about the world
"god comes but only if you wait
only if you prey"
well how can you be so sure?

dear god i've got a few complaints
i don't like the way things
are going now a-days
blood in east
blood in the west
probably in heaven too
though i've never seen the place.

dear god
i'm sorry i let you down
but down in this earth i've given all i got
when i look up now all i see is sky
preyers are songs to be sang
by the homeless
