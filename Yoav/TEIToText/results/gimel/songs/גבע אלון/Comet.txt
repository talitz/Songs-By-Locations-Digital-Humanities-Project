There’s a comet in the sky tonight
Look how it brightens the clear night’s sky
How it shines for everyone tonight
I wish that I could shine like that tonight
Where country boundaries are all out of sight
I’d shine the same for everyone tonight

There’s a comet heading north tonight
I bet the Lebanese can already see it’s light
I wonder if they freeze to see it tonight
And do they go back to be as children tonight
And to the brightness give up all their strife
And all our troubles are gone tonight

That’s how it figured in my mind
And for me that’s pretty just for a while
From where I stand that’s what I see
How many people gaze up high like me
And the comet sees no borders
Just catches every pair of eyes
Who wish they had a guiding light
And I wish I had a guiding light
A guiding light
I wish I had a guiding light
There’s a comet in the sky tonight
There’s a comet in the sky tonight
There’s a comet in the sky tonight
