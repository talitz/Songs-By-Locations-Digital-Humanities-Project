Days of Hunger won't you buy them for me
In my comfort,I'm too easy and pleased
And no strangers can burst inside through the breaks

Days of hunger won't you let them be free
Because we need them to sing a sad memory
In my heart now is where I want you to be

Falling leaves have left the tree
And it's naked for all to see
How i wish that I could be

Oh don't worry don't you worry for me
One bright morning so together we'll be
As my hunger sends my boat to the sea

Falling leaves have left the tree
And it's naked for all to see
How i wish that I could be

Days of Hunger won't you buy them for me
