The people back home know everything there is to know about me
I can be gone for years and still they’ll know where I’ve been
I read an article in the paper about people like me
Thought I’d outrun them by now but then back home
They always see everything that I see before me

The people back home tell every story there is to tell about me
And the stories they come up with are most of the time true
But me, I get confused by looking in the mirror
The only time I recognize myself is when I look at my dad
And get nervous from having to grow old without him

There’s a corner in my heart for the folks back home
There’s a corner in my heart for the folks back home

And my daddy says I should always remember my story
’cause there will come a time when all the folks back home will die
And that one day I will sit my children down
And tell them every story there is to tell about the folks back home
How they knew everything there was to know about me
And I’ll look at them and hope that one day I could say the same
There’s a corner in my heart for the folks back home
