Come on rider ‘cause I long to talk to you
Come on rider ‘cause your face is carved in blue
Since that day when I met you
I paid the bill but wasn’t through
And forever we are two

Come on rider ‘cause I long to talk to you
I guess for you I’m just a face that has no name
Just a pay and go away
But you left me out of clues
And forever we are two

Come on rider leave your riots and leave your men
‘Cause we all often give ourselves away for change
It always shines after the rains
Come on cry for me your blues
And forever we are two
