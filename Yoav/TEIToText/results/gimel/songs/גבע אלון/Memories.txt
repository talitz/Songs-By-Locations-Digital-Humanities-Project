I am the worst addict
I suffer many thrills
That always leave
A mark in me

This highway's never ending
It bring you to your knees
But no one's love is like it is

You've got no one above you
And so they say you're free
But that's not all that bothers me

I have never said a word about it
But never stopped believing don't you know
I haven't been around for you my darling
Surely memories won't guide you home

Somewhere in this desert
I will find my peace
I don't know how long it will be

My shell just keeps on breaking
Inside i long to see
The pearl that shows you what is real
Many people gathered from side to side
But that's not all that's on my mind

I have never said a word about it
But never stopped believing don't you know
I haven't been around for you my darling
Surely memories won't guide you home
