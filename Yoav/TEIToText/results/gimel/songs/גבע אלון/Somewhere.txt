They were building a wall in the sand
Between city and sea and my head
They all know it's a sin But still the wall remains
Dirty and far beyond reason

I wonder what's the plan Somewhere

They were talking about us and our fates
In a closed room where noone can hear
But me I'm not one who puts his life in the hands
Of people who don't care for the danger

I wonder what's the plan Somewhere
They were building the wall in the sand
Between city and sea and my head

They all know it's a sin But still the wall remains
Dirty and far beyond reason
I wonder what's the plan Somewhere
