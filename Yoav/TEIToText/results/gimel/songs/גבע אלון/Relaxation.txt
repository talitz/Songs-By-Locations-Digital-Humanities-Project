By the river this morning I went for a walk
In the Sun I feel good it releases my block
Relaxation is a breakthrough
To pay no worries to
Thoughts of dying in the gutter
They dont bother me no more
And the river started talking in a vibrating sound
As I laid down my head to the ground
Relaxation is a breakthrough
To pay no worries to
Thoughts of dying in the gutter
They dont bother me no more
Im curious as Im headed towards the river bend
Whats there behind the corner I wont dissent and will not end
Relaxation is a breakthrough
To pay no worries to
Thoughts of dying in the gutter
They dont bother me no more
As Im pissing on the grass an open field in front of me
I need your fake reality like I need a terminal disease
Relaxation is a breakthrough
To pay no worries to
Thoughts of dying in the gutter
They dont bother me no more
