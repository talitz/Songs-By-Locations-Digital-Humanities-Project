I hear the bells
Are you ready to cast spells on our relations?
Come race me now my love
With patience
We’re all machines
I hear some people call in tears for oiling
Come race me now my love
’til morning

And down this lonely road
I’m faster now
Much faster now
You won’t catch up my honey
Down, down
Come race me now my honey

Sometimes I look outside
Imagining that I am God and feel so sorry
How can men proudly call this glory
And down this lonely road
I’m faster now
Much faster now
