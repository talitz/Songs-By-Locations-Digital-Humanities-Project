And once again we are in jeopardy
Our crimes are aging just like you and me
For love is more than a dream
And I believe in walls of mystery
That block The Sun from everyone
When I’ll wake up you’ll be gone
And all that will be left is in my hands
To write a memory of love that’s dead
It echoes from a distance and fades away

And you and me we go in separate ways
Wish I could change all that has been done
The time when you were the one
This is today when I can’t see a thing
But what it is for the time being
And how it feels in my hands

But when it walks away I feel free
Freer than a bird above the open sea
Those words keep taking over our freedom years
