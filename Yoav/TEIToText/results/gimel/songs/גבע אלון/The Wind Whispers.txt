I can see a bright light up the hill there
Way beyond my wishful reach
And I know my cousin lives there
And he looks a lot like me
For years as I watch him closely
He watches back
And neither can tell what's on the other's mind
Is he about to come and get me
And stab a knife into my back
And it's getting darker now
And the light is dimming out
But the wind whispers love
Yeah the wind whispers love

Mama see the swirly mountains sigh there
How in my dreams I climbed them high
To the land of milk and honey
That the people have turned to mud
I know a creek that runs from way up there
Wish it could tell me the sights and sounds it saw
Because for water there are no borders
Or so I thought before I dried
And it's getting darker now
And the light is dimming out
But the wind whispers love
Yeah the wind whispers love

When all is worn out and gone
I'll think about a song
That echoes through fire and light
Above the changing sky
A lullaby
Bringing a new dawn to us all
We'll raise a cup to life
But now we're all so tired
And at the far end of the road
We wish to sing our sons
A lullaby
And it's getting darker now
And the light is dimming out
But the wind whispers love
Yeah the wind whispers love
