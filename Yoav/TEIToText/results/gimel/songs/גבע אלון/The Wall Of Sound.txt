I sit alone
On a wooden chair
The windows are shut
I don't care whats out there

The walls are white
With no distractions and I stare
At them and see a meadow somewhere

A scar less bayou is in my room
It's here so close
Nobody's around
Just me and the wall of sound
Just a wall of sound

And I sit for hours with all my toys to play
And ignorance is so good to me

A scar less bayou is in my room
It's here so close
Nobody's around
Just me and the wall of sound
Just a wall of sound

Someone approached me
I knew I could have her
I didn't hear a words at all
Just saw the meadow again
But it was different from back then
So strange
And I'm lost
So many bad weeds

When I was young
There was no reflection
All that I saw
Was good for me
