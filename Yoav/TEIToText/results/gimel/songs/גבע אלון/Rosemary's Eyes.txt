First time that i've felt
On the palm of my hand
laid a chance to
reach and touch my home land
and when I got there my rosemary sang

she stood windward
in a red evening gown
that was deep as the ocean
you could feel the water around
when I approached her
my rosemary said
don't look down

'cause theres no ground there
it's just your mind
kneel your head long
and you fall down
and when you're out there
in different times
don't forget me
'cause i'm your kind

I looked inside her
and saw a spring full of blooms
a child passed through me
I felt no aging or gloom
for just one moment
in rosemarys room

so I decided to keep hanging on
hoping she'll be there
the day I come home
and when I left her
she smiled with the dawn

'cause theres no ground there
it's just your mind
kneel your head long
and you fall down
and when you're out there
in different times
don't forget me
'cause i'm your kind

so if you're out there
see rosemary's eyes
