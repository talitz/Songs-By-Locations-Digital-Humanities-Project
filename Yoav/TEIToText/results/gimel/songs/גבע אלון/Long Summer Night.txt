You know you broke my heart into a million pieces
And it seems like it wasnt there at all
But you were to me just like a Sunday breeze
Now I cant love you anymore
Long summer night
Was ended with a cry
All those tears I cannot hold inside
Anymore
You know when youre not mine youre all Im dreaming of
A mystery just like an open road
But you came to me with your arms open wide
Now I cant love you anymore
Long summer night
Was ended with a cry
All those tears I cannot hold inside
Anymore
I feel like going away to somewhere peaceful
Somewhere where the rivers high and strong
Dive in it so deep so I could die in peace
No one will see me anymore
Long summer night
Was ended with a cry
All those tears I cannot hold inside
Anymore
