Well I dreamed of you my love
On that grassy hill of mine
Where there’s no one that knows me around
And we parted long ago
Hope you still recall my name
‘Cause I have traveled miles now
Trying to forget
And I long to see you just one more time
And I wish to ask you back into my life
I will be around you if you’ll have this dreaming child
I will be with you girl somewhere far in time
And the night was cold and rainy
In that grassy dream of mine
I saw you fading out in the dark
And every time that I feel lonely
I wish that you would come
And in your eyes I’ll wonder

Like I did that night
And I want to see you just one more time
Those dreams are mirrors
To what I see in myself
And I was a young boy
Who let you walk away
It’s like it was just yesterday
And I long to see you just one more time

And I wish to ask you back into my life
I will be around you if you’ll have this dreaming child
I will be with you girl somewhere far in time
