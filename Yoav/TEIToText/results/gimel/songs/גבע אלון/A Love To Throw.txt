Not far from reason
And not so far from home
I picked a flower I smelled it for so long
I dont want to force things in me
Although I wish
That I will find a place for love
Im not wise enough
To open up and let you through
Were not far from parting
Not far from loving too
Its all in the mist right now
Hard to tell whats in our path
Its hard to settle for something less
This evening will lead us
To a point of no return
A break to hold by
A love to throw
A break to hold by
A love to throw
