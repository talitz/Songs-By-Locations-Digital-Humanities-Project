In my head there's a melody
That I hear
Once it held my head high

Once I could stand to sing it loud
In ecstasy
The unaware never cares

And today
In a bar full of strangers, you see
How they dont care for me as I'm
Climbing up high
Yes today
I dont care for those strangers, you see
Blown away as my melody's
Climbing up high
My melody's climbing up high

In my head there's a memory
Of the one
Who faded out in a song
And became just a melody
And not a girl
Or love that pours light in your eyes

And today
In a bar full of strangers, you see
How they dont care for me as I'm
Climbing up high
Yes today
I dont care for those strangers, you see
Blown away as my melody's
Climbing up high
My melody's climbing up high

In my head
In my head
Once I held my head high
