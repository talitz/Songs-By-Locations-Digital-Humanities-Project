On this birthday
I dream away
It’s a pile of hay
In my bed
Everyone is missing from my TV screen
It’s just electric snow for miles and miles we take a walk

On this birthday
I seize the day
Got my things all packed
In my Cadillac
I’ll take it for a ride all down the line
Hope to run into you
we’ll waste ourselves on the endless truth

Oh what a drag you had to go
Oh you don’t know just what I know
Oh what a drag you had to go

On this day of birth
I’m down to Earth
Hear the radio
On an asphalt road
I know they’re coming soon
so what else can I do
I’m just in love with you
that’s all the bad and all the good
