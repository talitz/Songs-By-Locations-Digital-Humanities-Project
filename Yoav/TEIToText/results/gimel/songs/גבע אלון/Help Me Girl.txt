Help me girl my legs are broken
In a hospital I lay
Reminiscing California sunsets
That I once met
I don’t know how I ended up here
What hit me when I saw the light
If only I knew how to whistle
To pass the time
Help me girl I think I’m dying
But to my movie there’s no end
I just keep on rolling
Tape by tape
Until they kick me out to the rain
