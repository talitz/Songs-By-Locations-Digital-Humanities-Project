You gone fishin'
Well therte's a sign upon your door
Gone fishin'
You ain't working anymore?
There's your hoe out in the sun
where you left a row half done
you claim that hochin' that ain't no fun
you ain't no ambitionâ€¦

gone fishin'
by a shady wady pool
I'm wishin' I could be that kind of full
I'd say no more work for mine
On my door I'd hang a sign
Gone fishin',
Instead of jest a wishin'.
