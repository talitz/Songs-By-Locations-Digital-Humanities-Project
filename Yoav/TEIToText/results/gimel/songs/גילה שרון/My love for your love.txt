If tomorrow is a judgement day
And I am standin' on the front line
And the lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you….

If I wake up in world war 3
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home-
It's okay, if you comin' with me –

'cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us…
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune,
And I'm homeless on the street..
And I'm sleepin' in grand central station
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me

As the years, they pass us by
We stay young through each other eyes..
And no matter how old we get
It's okay, as long as I got you babe…

'cause your love……………….

If I should die this very day
Don't cry, 'cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what people say
I'll be waiting for you, after judgement day

'cause your love…………….
