I’m afraid to succeed, I’m afraid to fail
I’m afraid to wake up, I’m afraid to sleep
I’m afraid of work, I’m afraid of being lazy
I’m afraid of you,
I’m afraid of me

All the people say
I’m in love with her today
Hey hey hey
All this darkness illuminates darkness
When the pain is sweet

I’mafraid to starve,
I’m afraid of getting fat
I’m afraid to shout, I’m afraid to
shut up
I’m afraid to buy, I’m afraid of being bought
I’m afraid to go,
I’m afraid to come
