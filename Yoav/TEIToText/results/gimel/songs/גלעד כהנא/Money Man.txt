He covers his face with a handkerchief
Looks at the puddle
Cant stop the tear
How a ripple shakes the world

Money money money man
With his pants down
Crying like a baby
I aint got nothing
I aint got nothing
To make me happy

Once he was tough
But not today
He had an argument
With his phillipino nurse
And he crumbles

Money money money man
With his pants down
Crying like a baby
I aint got nothing
I aint got nothing
To make me happy

In the middle of the night
When he’ll wake her up
To change his sheets
He’s gotta forgive her
Even if the silly girl
She wont apologize

“Bakit sino ba sya sa akala niya
Hindi ako ang nanay niya
…Im
not his wife
Never once saying thank you
Who does he think he is?
Siya ang bobong tao
Napa ka tanga…”

Money money money man
With his pants down
Crying like a baby
I aint got nothing
I aint got nothing
To make me happy

I don’t believe he didn’t say he is sorry
