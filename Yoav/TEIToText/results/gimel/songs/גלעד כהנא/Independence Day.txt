I miss my father / I regret so many things / especially the words I didn't say / I didn't ask how it felt on independence day / when they all were happy / on Rothschild boulevard / thousands of people / dancing the horah in the streets / waiting for a miracle / in my dreams I hope/ waiting for a miracle / to see my dad / and tell him one more time / waiting for a miracle / they say I have his sense of humor / they say I have his voice / when he was my age / he destroyed a couple of bridges with dynamite / and I thought we were the opposite soldier and a poet / but I was wrong / and now I know the truth / I am him / exactly when he gone / waiting for a miracle / in my dreams I hope/ waiting for a miracle / to see my dad / and tell him one more time / waiting for a miracle / in my dreams I hope to meet him / waiting for a miracle
