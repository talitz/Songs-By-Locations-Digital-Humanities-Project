Softness is the name of the game
Like feathers falling in love
I can hear myself calling your name
Don't want you to fit me like a glove

I touch you from a far
So delicate so wild
The light of night shines from your eyes
Your heart should be a place where beauty lies

Kindness is what I should practice
I hope you'll make it all worth while
I've never known nothing like this
Don't want you to fit me like a glove

I touch you from a far
So delicate so wild
The light of night shines from your eyes
Your heart should be a place where beauty lies
