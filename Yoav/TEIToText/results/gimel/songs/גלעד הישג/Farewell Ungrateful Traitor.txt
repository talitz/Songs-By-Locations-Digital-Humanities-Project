Farewell ungrateful traitor!
Farewell my perjur'd swain!
Let never injur'd woman
Believe a man again.

'Tis easy to deceive us
In pity of your pain,
But when we love, you leave us
To rail at you in vain.

Before we have descried it,
There is no joy beside it,
But she that once has tried it
Will never love again.

Farewell ungrateful traitor!
Farewell my perjur'd swain!
Let never injur'd woman
Believe a man again.

The passion you pretended
Was only to obtain,
But once the charm is ended,
The charmer you disdain.

Your love by ours we measure
Till we have lost our treasure,
Your love by ours we measure
But dying is a pleasure when living is a pain.

Farewell ungrateful traitor!
Farewell my perjur'd swain!
Let never injur'd woman
Believe a man again.
